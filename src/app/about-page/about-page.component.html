        <p>
          I am an allround web developer.
          Iâ€™ve always sought out opportunities and challenges that are meaningful to me.
          I've never stopped engaging my passion to help others and solve problems.
          As a web developer, I enjoy using my obsessive attention to detail, my unequivocal love for making things,
          and my mission-driven work ethic to literally change the world.
          Also I like working in a team, you'll learn faster and much more.
          As the saying goes: 'two heads are better than one'.
